# KV Cache Visualization Explanations

## 1. Layer-wise Heatmaps (`kv_cache_layers.png`)

These heatmaps show the key and value tensors for each layer in the model:

- **What you're seeing**: Each row represents a token position in your input sequence, and each column represents the combined dimensions across all attention heads.
- **Color intensity**: Brighter colors indicate larger absolute values; darker areas indicate values closer to zero.
- **Patterns to look for**:
  - **Vertical stripes**: Indicates specific head dimensions that are consistently active across positions.
  - **Horizontal stripes**: Shows token positions that trigger strong activations.
  - **Sparse areas**: Dark regions indicate potential for pruning.
  - **Changes across layers**: Earlier layers often capture more local patterns, while later layers capture more abstract semantics.

## 2. Layer Statistics Plots (`kv_cache_statistics.png`)

This figure contains four subplots showing critical metrics across layers:

### a) Sparsity Across Layers

- **What it shows**: The percentage of near-zero values (< 1e-5) in keys and values for each layer.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Higher values mean more potential for pruning.
  - Layers with 30%+ sparsity are prime candidates for optimization.
  - If sparsity increases in later layers, these layers may be less critical.

### b) Key-Value Correlation Across Layers

- **What it shows**: The correlation coefficient between key and value tensors for each layer.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Higher correlation suggests redundancy between keys and values.
  - Layers with correlation > 0.5 might benefit from shared representations.
  - Spikes in correlation indicate layers where keys and values capture similar information.

### c) Standard Deviation Across Layers

- **What it shows**: How widely the values are spread in each layer.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Higher std dev indicates more diverse representations.
  - Decreasing std dev in later layers might indicate information consolidation.
  - Large differences between key and value std dev suggest different roles.

### d) Mean Absolute Value Across Layers

- **What it shows**: The average magnitude of values in each layer.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Indicates overall activation strength.
  - Declining means in later layers suggest diminishing importance.
  - Consistent means suggest evenly distributed importance across layers.

## 3. Value Distribution Histograms (`kv_value_distribution.png`)

These histograms show the distribution of values in the key and value tensors:

- **What you're seeing**: The frequency distribution of values across the entire KV cache.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Bell-shaped curve**: Values follow normal distribution (good for uniform quantization).
  - **Long tails**: Some values are much larger than others (may need non-uniform quantization).
  - **Multiple peaks**: Different groups of values serve different functions.
  - **Width of distribution**: Wider distributions need more bits to represent accurately.

## 4. PCA of Keys and Values by Position (`kv_pca_by_position.png`)

This visualization reduces the high-dimensional KV cache to 2D, showing how token positions relate:

- **What you're seeing**: Each point represents a token position, colored by its sequence position.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Clustered points**: Positions with similar representations.
  - **Smooth color transitions**: Sequential processing of information.
  - **Outliers**: Special tokens or semantic boundaries.
  - Distinct patterns may indicate tokens that need different treatment in optimization.

## 5. Head Specialization (`head_specialization.png`)

This shows how different attention heads cluster for a specific layer:

- **What you're seeing**: Each point represents one attention head, projected into 2D space.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Clustered heads**: Potentially redundant and candidates for pruning.
  - **Distant heads**: Serve different functions and should be preserved.
  - **Even spacing**: Well-differentiated responsibilities among heads.
- This helps identify which heads are critical vs. expendable.

## 6. Quantization Error Analysis (`kv_quantization_error.png`)

Shows how reducing precision affects representation accuracy:

- **What you're seeing**: Error introduced by quantizing to different bit precisions (16, 8, 4, 2).
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Knees in the curve**: Points where error increases dramatically.
  - **Lower error at 8-bit**: Model may work well with 8-bit quantization.
  - **Large gap between key and value lines**: They may require different quantization strategies.
- This directly informs how aggressively you can quantize without significant accuracy loss.

## 7. Low Importance Tokens (`low_importance_tokens.png`)

This visualization highlights tokens with the lowest magnitudes in the KV cache:

- **What you're seeing**: A scatter plot where each point represents a token, with color indicating position in sequence and red X markers highlighting the lowest-magnitude tokens.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Red X markers**: Tokens with minimal impact on model predictions.
  - **Token labels**: The actual text of low-importance tokens.
  - **Position coloring**: Whether low-importance tokens occur in specific sequence positions.
- These tokens are prime candidates for aggressive pruning or early dropping in KV cache optimization.

---

## 8. Token Importance Comparison (`token_importance_comparison.png`)

This visualization contrasts the highest and lowest importance tokens in the model:

- **What you're seeing**: A scatter plot with tokens positioned by their key and value magnitudes, with high-importance tokens in blue and low-importance tokens in red.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Blue points**: Tokens with highest magnitude, critical for model understanding.
  - **Red points**: Tokens with lowest magnitude, potential for pruning.
  - **Clustering patterns**: Whether certain types of tokens consistently have high/low importance.
  - **Diagonal patterns**: Correlation between key and value magnitudes.
- This helps identify which specific tokens contribute most and least to model performance.

## 9. Token Magnitude Distributions (`token_magnitude_distributions.png`)

These boxplots show the distribution of key and value magnitudes across different token types:

- **What you're seeing**: Distributions of magnitudes separated by token categories (numbers, punctuation, stopwords, proper nouns, etc.).
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Box height**: Variability within each token type.
  - **Median line**: Typical magnitude for that token type.
  - **Outliers**: Tokens that deviate significantly from their type.
  - **Comparisons across types**: Which categories generally have higher or lower magnitudes.
- This reveals which types of tokens could be treated differently in KV cache optimization strategies.

## 10. Token Magnitudes by Position (`token_magnitudes.png`)

This visualization shows how key and value magnitudes vary by token position and type:

- **What you're seeing**: Two plots - the top shows magnitude by sequence position, and the bottom shows average magnitudes by token type.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Position patterns**: Whether earlier or later tokens have higher magnitudes.
  - **Spikes**: Positions of particularly important tokens.
  - **Bar chart**: Direct comparison of average magnitudes across different token types.
  - **Key vs. Value comparison**: Whether key and value magnitudes follow similar patterns.
- This helps identify position-based patterns for potential optimizations like progressive KV cache pruning.

---

## 11. Token Key-Value Scatter (`token_key_value_scatter.png`)

This visualization maps tokens in 2D space based on their key and value magnitudes:

- **What you're seeing**: Each point represents a token, positioned by key magnitude (x-axis) and value magnitude (y-axis), colored by position in sequence.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Clusters**: Groups of tokens with similar importance patterns.
  - **Position coloring**: Whether token importance correlates with sequence position.
  - **Labeled tokens**: The highest-magnitude tokens with their text values.
  - **Diagonal trend**: Correlation between key and value magnitudes across tokens.
- This visualization helps identify outlier tokens that might require special handling in optimizations.
